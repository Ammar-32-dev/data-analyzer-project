# DataCore Analytics - Critical Fixes Applied

## Overview
All critical backend and frontend issues have been resolved. The application is now fully functional with improved error handling, better layout, and enhanced user experience.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Functionality Improvements

#### File Upload & Processing
- **Added Empty File Validation**: The system now checks if uploaded files are empty before processing

- **Session Management**: Implemented explicit session modification tracking with `request.session.modified = True`
- **Improved Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the upload and analysis pipeline

#### Session Configuration
- **Database-Backed Sessions**: Configured Django to use database-backed sessions for reliability
- **Session Persistence**: Enabled `SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = True` to ensure data is saved
- **Extended Session Lifetime**: Set `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 86400` (24 hours)
- **Security Settings**: Configured `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE`

### 2. Results Page Layout Fixes

#### Header Size Reduction
- **Dashboard Header Padding**: Reduced from 48px to 32px (var(--spacing-6) → var(--spacing-4))
- **Dashboard Title Size**: Reduced from 48px to 36px font size
- **Title Margin**: Reduced bottom margin from 32px to 24px
- **Overall Height Reduction**: Total sticky header height reduced by ~28px

#### Content Spacing Improvements
- **Section Padding**: Reduced from 64px to 48px (var(--spacing-8) → var(--spacing-6))
